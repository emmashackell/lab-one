## Things I have written.

My name is Emma Shackell, and my favorite thing I have ever written is a speech I wrote for my dads wedding. This speech happened about 2 years ago at a destination wedding in mexico.

This speech got a lot of laughs and even tears. To this day it was one of my best written pieces of all time in my personal opinion.

The funny thing about this speech being my favorite is that I wasn't supposed to give one in the first place. I wrote this speech on some napkins at dinner because my sister (the one who was supposed to give a speech) got stage fright and we had to fill time. The speech took me about 10 minutes to write and then somebody handed me a microphone and that was it.
